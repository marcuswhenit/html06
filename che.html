        <h1>Who Is che?</h1>
        <div class="d1">Chase Shaun Mitchell (born August 29, 2006), professionally known as OsamaSon, is a recording
            artist
            and
            record
            producer from Atlanta, Georgia.</div>

        <div class="d2">che started rapping in 2021, releasing his first song, kind, in september of
            2021.
            After che had
            released a couple singles through SoundCloud and spotify, che would
            see
            his first success in the underground scene in April 2023, with the song “agenda”. The song spread around
            TikTok like a wildfire making him one of the most popular ungerground artists at the time</div>


        <div class="d3">On Feburary 10th, 2023, che would release some teaser songs for his next album "closed
            captions". He released 2 songs with the named of blac chyna, and bluberry bakwood. che released his album on
            July 21st, 2023 which would earn him
            immediate success, thanks to songs such as "sol", “frank ocean,” “flat (bonus),” and most notably “blac
            chyna". Unlike OsamaSon, che had his fair share of social media exposure already and was already talked
            about,
            so the album stayed pretty closed off to a niche audience.</div>


        <div class="d4">Since the release of closed captions, che has since continued to release music. On October 11th,
            2023, che released a small project called "Before Crueger" that only had 2 songs. everyone knew that he was
            going to drop another album or EP soon because "Before Ccrueger" states that this was literally before
            a project named Crueger. che released his EP, Crueger on October 31st, 2023."</div>


        <div class="d5">
            For 2024, che previed a snippet of a song labled "Bae" on TikTok. This video gained lots of traction and had
            people wanting che to release the full song to the public. With it,s popularity, che decided to drop the
            song on Feburary 14th, 2024.
